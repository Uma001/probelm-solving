    Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the number of pairs in A whose sum is divisible by B.
    Return the total number of pairs for which the sum is divisible by B modulo (109 + 7).
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    B = 2
    All pairs which are divisible by 2 are (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (3,5).
    So total 4 pairs.
